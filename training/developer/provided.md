# Provided Resources

To follow this course you must have access to a: 

 - Running Nuvla service and

 - "Target" Docker Swarm infrastructure.

If you're participating in a **formal, organized training course**
with an instructor, access to these will be provided.  If you're
following this course **on your own**, you may need to deploy those
services. Instructions are available [elsewhere in the
documentation](/administrators.html), but require significant service
administration experience.
