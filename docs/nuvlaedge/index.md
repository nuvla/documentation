With NuvlaEdge (**NE**), you can transform most ARM and x86 hardware platforms into a smart edge device, managed by the Nuvla Platform as a Service.

To ensure a smooth edge deployment and operation, SixSq has certified a number of [hardware platforms](https://sixsq.com/nuvlaedge#hardware), including x86 and ARM based systems.  

But if you prefer to run on a different platform, SixSq offers a certification service, which will ensure you are able to deploy to this platform, at scale, without issues. Further, SixSq can also certify base operating systems (OS).  Therefore, if you have your own operating system, as long as it supports Docker, SixSq also offers a certification process, ensuring that your operating system can run as a NuvlaEdge OS.

NuvlaEdge is open source, so feel free to explore the code and perform your own experiments.
