With NuvlaEdge (**NE**), you can transform most ARM and x86 hardware platforms into a smart edge device, managed by the Nuvla Platform as a Service.

To ensure a smooth edge deployment and operation, SixSq has certified a number of [hardware platforms](https://sixsq.com/nuvlaedge#hardware), including x86 and ARM based systems.  

SixSq also offers a certification service. Therefore, if you prefer a different platform, we will ensure you are able to deploy to your platform, at scale, without issues.

Further, SixSq can also certify base operating systems (OS).  Therefore, if you have your own operating system, as long as it supports Docker, SixSq can certify it, ensuring that your operating system can run NuvlaEdge without issues.

NuvlaEdge is open source, so feel free to explore the code and perform your own experiments.
