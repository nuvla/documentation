NuvlaEdge Engine
========

The NuvlaEdge Engine (**NEE**) is the heart of the NuvlaEdge (**NE**). It provides the foundation services of the NB, which in turn ensure a robust, feature-rich and secure remote management from Nuvla.

The NEE is implemented as a set of loosely coupled, open-source and containerised micro-services. You can find NEE's source code in [NuvlaEdge's GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nuvlabox).

You can find all releases of the NEE at [https://github.com/nuvlabox/deployment](https://github.com/nuvlabox/deployment).
