Discover NuvlaEdge
========

The NuvlaEdge (**NE**) the edge software component of the Nuvla edge ecosystem. It provides the foundation services that need to run in your edge devices, servers and virtual machines, which in turn ensure a robust, feature-rich and secure remote management from Nuvla.

The NE is implemented as a set of loosely coupled, open-source and containerised micro-services. You can find NE's source code in [NuvlaEdge's GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nuvlaedge), as well as all its [releases](https://github.com/nuvlaedge/deployment).
