# Nuvla - What is it?

Nuvla is a secured edge-to-cloud (and back) management platform that enables near-data AI for a connected world.

The container native platform supports all forms of infrastructure: public cloud, private cloud and bare metal infrastructures, as well as edge (with our NuvlaBox).

This documentation is intended for the users of a Nuvla platform.



The open and secure Nuvla® service by SixSq is a secure edge-to-cloud management platform which facilitates the implementation of operational edge-to-cloud solutions. The solution leverages near data processing, edge and cloud computing, as well as smart data management. It optimises the different skills required to realise real-life solutions, ensuring the project is put on a path towards success.
