Conclusions
===========

## Summary

This training course has shown you how to run containerized
applications through Nuvla, register new applications with Nuvla, and
how to provide customized applications that integrate well with the
Nuvla API and UI. In addition, the full lifecycle for data objects,
metadata, and data sets has been shown. The uniform data model across
infrastructures and the integration of data management with container
management are unique features of Nuvla.

## Next Steps

After taking this course, we encourage you to try using Nuvla with
your own applications and data analyses. The Nuvla code base is young,
so your feedback on the current features and your requests for new
features will have a large impact on the development roadmap.

## Nuvla Roadmap

Nuvla already provides basic container and data management features
that can be used in many domains.  It is evolving rapidly with
improvements planned in several areas: 

   1. Container management: management of multi-container
      applications, authenticated repositories, monitoring, and
      debugging facilties.
   
   1. Data management: provide application placement policies based on
      data locations and allow data management through the user
      interface.
   
   1. Infrastructure Support: support other popular container
      orchestration engines such as Kubernetes.
   
   1. NuvlaBox: provide support for edge computing devices that can
      analyze data from sensors and control equipment intelligently.

Again, your feedback on the above features or missing features will
help prioritize the development activities and guide the evolution of
Nuvla.
