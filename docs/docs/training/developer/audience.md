Target Audience
===============

This training course targets primarily people who will:

 - Develop applications (Clara) that will be deployed by end-users,
   
 - Manage data (Emma) for consumption by end-users via applications,
   and

 - Integrate Swarm infrastructures (Dave) with Nuvla that provide
   compute and storage resources.

Information about end-users' (Alice) interactions with Nuvla will also
be provided so that the audience can understand the benefits of how
Nuvla combines container-based applications, data management, and
computing resources.
