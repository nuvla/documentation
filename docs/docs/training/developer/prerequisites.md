Prerequisites
=============

 - Participants will use their own laptops for the training.  Those
   laptops must have:
   
    - Access to the Internet,
    
    - [Docker Engine installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and

    - A working [Python (2.7+ or 3.x)
      environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
 - Basic knowledge of Docker, including how container-based
   applications are created and deployed. Reading the [Docker Getting
   Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) before the
   training is highly recommended.

 - [Basic knowledge](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) of
   programming in Python. The [Nuvla Python
   API](https://pypi.org/project/nuvla-api/) will be used to show
   programmatic interaction with Nuvla and is the primary language for
   (most) containers used in the demonstrations.

 - An account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). If you are
   taking this course with an instructor, you will be given access to
   the "nuvlatraining" organization to publish the containers you
   create during the training. If not, you can create your own
   organization on Docker Hub.
