Prerequisites
=============

 - Participants will use their own laptops for the training.  Those
   laptops must have:
   
    - Access to the Internet,
    
    - [Docker Engine installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and

    - A working [Python (2.7+ or 3.x)
      environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
 - Basic knowledge of Docker, including how container-based
   applications are created and deployed. Reading the [Docker Getting
   Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) before the
   training is highly recommended.

 - [Basic knowledge](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) of
   programming in Python. The [Nuvla Python
   API](https://pypi.org/project/nuvla-api/) will be used to show
   programmatic interaction with Nuvla and is the primary language for
   (most) containers used in the demonstrations.

 - An account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).  From your
   account, you'll need to create a repository to hold your customized
   images.
