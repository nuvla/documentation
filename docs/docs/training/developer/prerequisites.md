Prerequisites
=============

   1. Participants will use their own laptops for the training.  Those
      laptops must have access to the Internet, have [Docker Engine
      installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/), and have a working
      [Python (2.7+ or 3.x)
      environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
   
   1. Basic knowledge of Docker and how container-based applications
      are created and deployed. Going through the [Docker Getting
      Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/) before the
      training is highly recommended.

   1. [Basic knowledge](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide)
      of programming in Python. The [Nuvla Python
      API](https://pypi.org/project/nuvla-api/) will be used to show
      programmatic interaction with Nuvla and is the primary language
      for (most) containers used in the demonstrations.

   1. An account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/). You will be
      given access to the "nuvlatraining" organization to publish the
      containers you create during the training.
