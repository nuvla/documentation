Provided Resources
==================

If you're participating in a **formal, organized training course**
with an instructor, the following will be provided:

 - Access to a running Nuvla service and a "target" Docker Swarm
   infrastructure that provides compute and storage resources for the
   training.

If you're following this course **on your own**, you'll need to have
access to a:

 - Running Nuvla service and

 - "Target" Docker Swarm infrastructure.

Instructions for deploying those services are available [elsewhere in
the documentation](/administrators.html).
