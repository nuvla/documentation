# Bob: the project manager

Bob's main responsibility is to manage users on Nuvla. Working with [Dave](/dave) the operator or system administrator of the Nuvla installation, Bob can create and manage credentials, which he can then share with users.

Bob can also invite users. The fine grained security and authorisation feature of Nuvla provides Bob with great control over who can view and modify what.
