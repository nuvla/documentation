Prerequisites
=============

To get going, as Clara, you'll need a local development environment. This minimum kit is:

 - [Docker Engine installed](https://docs.docker.com/install/)

 - A working [Python (2.7+ or 3.x) environment](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

In terms of background knowledge, this documentation assumes you have the following foundation:
   
 - Basic knowledge of Docker, including how container-based applications are created and deployed. If you need a refresher or get up to speed with Docker, have a look at the [Docker Getting Started Guide](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/).

 - [Basic knowledge](https://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide) of programming in Python. The [Nuvla Python API](https://pypi.org/project/nuvla-api/) will be used to show programmatic interaction with Nuvla and is the primary language for (most) containers used in the demonstrations.

 - An account on [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/).  From your account, you'll need to create a repository to hold your customised images.
