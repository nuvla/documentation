Quick Nuvla Deployment
================

The Nuvla services and their dependent services are all containerised and can be deployed easily into a Docker Swarm cluster.

While for [production deployment](/docs/dave/prod/nuvla-prod) we recommend to split the stateful and stateless services, for this quick deployment, we will deploy all services together on a single node.

This installation assumes that you will only use the `super` user. If you want to invite or create other users from this setup, you will need to configure SMTP. [Here are the instructions](/docs/dave/prod/nuvla-deployment#smtp-configuration). 

## Prerequisites

We recommend deploying Nuvla on a Docker Swarm cluster (CaaS). If you don't have one yet, just [follow these simple instructions](/docs/dave/quick/caas-infrastructures#caas-deployment) to setup your own. If you are on MacOS, simply install the [Mac distribution](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/) and you should be good to go. 

If running Docker locally, you'll need to initialise your deployment to run in swarm mode. Just run the command:

    docker swarm init

The `docker stack` commands below should then work.

## Clone GitHub Repository

Clone the [nuvla/deployment](https://github.com/nuvla/deployment) GitHub
repository:

    git clone https://github.com/nuvla/deployment

This repo contains all the the Docker compose files you need to setup Nuvla.

## Deploy

The `deployment` repository contains a `demo` folder that includes a compose file. This file contains all the instructions to start the different containers composing the Nuvla micro-service architecture. This compose file will use all latest released version of the Nuvla software.

    cd deployment/demo
    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml nuvla

This will create a set of Docker service, prefixed with the last argument provided above (in our example: `nuvla`).

Now verify that all of the services start by listing them with Docker:

    docker stack ls
    docker service ls

You should also verify that the API server has fully started by inspecting the logs:

    docker service logs -f nuvla_api

After the configuration messages, the log should indicate that a server has been started on port 8200. Once this is the case, you can visit https://<master-ip>/api/cloud-entry-point, which should return a directory of the available resources in JSON format.

Similarly, you can verify that the web browser interface is available by visiting https://<master-ip>/. You should see the Nuvla UI with a login button in the upper-right corner.

## Invite users

Probably not relevant in case of the local test deployment, but in order to invite users, you will need to configure Nuvla with SMTP parameters. For details see [these instructions](/docs/dave/prod/nuvla-deployment#smtp-configuration).
