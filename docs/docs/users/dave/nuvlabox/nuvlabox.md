NuvlaBox
========

The NuvlaBox software allows Dave to transform most ARM and x86 hardware platform into a smart edge device, managed by a Nuvla service.

SixSq has certified a number of hardware platforms. Using such platforms ensures a smooth deployment.  For x86 based systems, these include machines from HPE, Dell and Logic Supply. For ARM based systems, these include Raspberry Pi.  For a complete list, please refer to [SixSq website](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/tech-spec).

But if you prefer to run a different platform, SixSq offers a certification service, which will ensure you are able to deploy to this platform, at scale, without issues. Further, SixSq can also certify base operating systems (OS).  Therefore, if you have your own operating system, as long as it supports Docker, SixSq also offers a certification process, ensuring that your operating system can run as a NuvlaBox OS. 

The core of the NuvlaBox software is the [NuvlaBox Engine](/docs/dave/nuvlabox/nuvlabox-engine)
