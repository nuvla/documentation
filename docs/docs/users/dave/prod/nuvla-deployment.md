Nuvla Deployment
================

The Nuvla services and their dependent services are all containerised and can be deployed easily into a Docker Swarm cluster. The deployment has been split into two groups to facilitate the management of the services:

 - **db**: Deploys the database elements of the Nuvla software stack, which consists of Elasticsearch and Zookeeper. 

 - **core**: Deploys the "business logic" of Nuvla, which consists of a number of micro-services.

A graphical overview of the Nuvla deployment can be seen below (on the right).

Before starting, review the entire deployment procedure.  The [nuvla/deployment](https://github.com/nuvla/deployment) GitHub repository contains files that will help you deploy Nuvla.

## Prerequisites

Review the requirements for the **host** Docker Swarm cluster that you will use to deploy Nuvla. These can be found in the [Docker Swarm Infrastructures](/docs/dave/prod/caas-infrastructures) section. In particular, **be sure that you have created the "traefik-public" network and that Traefik has been deployed**.

## Backend Network

The Nuvla services and their dependencies communicate over a network that is not accessible publicly. Because this is shared between separate deployments, it must be created manually. 

Create the private, backend overlay network by running the following command on the master node of the Swarm cluster:

    docker network create --driver=overlay nuvla-backend

Verify that the network has been properly created by using `docker network ls`.

## Database

Nuvla uses Elasticsearch to store the vast majority of its state, including all the stored documents that represent resources in the system. Zookeeper stores the remaining state, which consists of the states of asynchronous jobs in the system.

**Before** trying to deploy Nuvla's core services, first start the database elements.  To do so, clone the nuvla/deployment repository on the Docker Swarm master.

Navigate to the "prod/db" directory in your checked out repository. There you execute the command:

    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml db

Verify that the Elasticsearch and Zookeeper services come up correctly, by listing them with Docker (`docker service ls`) or by inspecting the logs.

## Core Services

Once the database services have been deployed, you can then deploy the core services for Nuvla.  In your clone of the nuvla/deployment repository, navigate to the "prod/core" directory. To do so, execute the commands:

    ./generate-certificates.sh
    docker stack deploy -c docker-compose.yml nuvla

Verify that all of the services start by listing them with Docker.

You should also verify that the API server has fully started by inspecting the logs:

    docker service logs -f nuvla_api

After the configuration messages, the log should indicate that a server has been started on port 8200. Once this is the case, you can visit https://<master-ip>/api/cloud-entry-point, which should return a directory of the available resources in JSON format.

Similarly, you can verify that the web browser interface is available by visiting https://<master-ip>/. You should see the Nuvla UI with a login button in the upper-right corner.

## Configuration

### Administrator Password

If you have used the default password for the "super" (administrator) account, you should change it before providing access to other users. From the Nuvla welcome page, click the login button, fill in the form with the administrator credentials, and click "login".

If you have successfully logged in, the button in the upper, right corner should have the administrator's username "super" as the label. When you click on the button, you will see the profile page, which contains a button to reset your password.
