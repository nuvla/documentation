Production Nuvla Deployment
================

If you are looking for quick instructions on how to deploy Nuvla or to simply give it a try for evaluation, we suggest you have a look at the [quick guide](/docs/dave/quick/nuvla-deployment.html). 

The Nuvla services and their dependent services are all containerised and can be deployed easily into a CaaS (e.g. Docker Swarm cluster).

For production, we recommend to split the deployment of Nuvla stateless and supporting stateful services. Such deployment provides a much more resilient service.

> **Warning**: do not use these instructions to run a commercial service based on these instructions. In this case, we strongly recommend you get in touch with the [SixSq team](mailto:support@sixsq.com).
