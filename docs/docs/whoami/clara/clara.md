This section of the documentation is for [Clara](/whoami#clara-the-it-specialist). Here you will find instructions on how to register existing Docker containers with Nuvla, but also create your own Docker containers, able to leverage Nuvla features to simplify your life and the life of colleagues wanting to deploy applications, such as [Alice](/alice) and [Emme](/emma).
