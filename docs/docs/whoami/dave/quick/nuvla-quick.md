Quick demo Nuvla Deployment
================

Here's a simple guide to quickly install Nuvla for evaluation purposes. So if you're looking for quickly trying out Nuvla, you're at the right place. However, if you're looking for a robust production level installation, you probably want to look at [the production deployment page](/docs/dave/prod/nuvla-prod).

The Nuvla services and their dependent services are all containerised and can be deployed easily into a Docker Swarm CaaS cluster. For this quick deployment, we will deploy all services together on a single node.
