# Felix - Nuvla Developer

[Felix](/felix) is a software developer and in the Nuvla context.  **And yes we know... like us, he's very cool! :-P**

He is contributing to the Nuvla code base. Since Nuvla is primarily built using Clojure, Clojurescript and Python, he is fluent in these languages and their eco-systems.
