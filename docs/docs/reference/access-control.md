# Access Control

Access to each collection and resource within the Nuvla service is
protected by an Access Control List (ACL). An ACL identifies the
owners of the resources and "principals" with specific access
rights. The both owners and principals take the form of a resource
identifier within an ACL, for example, "group/nuvla-admin" or
"user/0d20f265-af45-48a8-a32f-a8debd8c4e61".

When user's authenticate with Nuvla, their session contains a list of
associated principals; this list is sometimes referred to as the
user's "claims". The server evaluates an ACL using these claims to
decide whether to grant access or not. 

The ACL implementation provides fine-grained access control while, at
the same time, allowing fast, database-level of the ACLs. One
side-effect of the focus on database-level performance is that the
support ACL syntax only allows for **positive** rights to be
expressed. Rules like "user X is denied access to resource Y" cannot
be expressed with the Nuvla ACLs.

## Resource ACLs

Each resource contains an ACL that is stored along with the other
attributes of the resource. Consequently, the ACL is expressed as a
JSON object.  An example of an ACL is:

```json
{
  "owners": ["group/nuvla-admin"],
  
  "view-meta": ["group/nuvla-user", "user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],  
  "view-data": ["group/nuvla-user", "user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],
  "view-acl": ["user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],
  
  "edit-meta": ["user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],
  "edit-data": ["user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],
  "edit-acl": ["user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],
  
  "delete": ["user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"],
  "manage": ["user/37997228-baac-4744-b080-454ea7524258"]  
}
```

The owners always have **full access** to the resource; consequently,
they do not need to be specified in the detailed rights that follow.

The **view-meta/data/acl**" rights allow the given principals to
retrieve the associated segment of the resource. See below for a
description of the three segments of a resource.

The **edit-meta/data/acl**" rights allow the given principals to
modify the associated segment of the resource.

The **delete** and **manage** rights allow the given principals to
delete or to run actions ("manage") a resource, respectively. These
actions include, for example, the "start" and "stop" actions of a
deployment.

The above example shows a fully **normalized** ACL. The owner
principals do not appear in the detailed rights lists and the rights
for other principals are explicitly given, even though some rights
imply others (see the hierarchy section below). ACLs are always
normalized before they are stored. Clients may provide abbreviated
ACLs, which will then be normalized by the server.

### Resource Segments

Each resource contains three segments: meta, data, and acl. The view
and edit rights for each of these segments is handled separately.  The
following diagram shows these segments.

![Resource Segments]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/reference/assets/resource-segments.png)

The **meta** segment contains the metadata of the resource. It
consists exclusively of the attributes: id, resource-type, subtype,
created, updated, parent, and tags.

The **acl** segment consists of only the acl attribute.

The **data** segment consists of all attributes that are not in the
meta and acl segments, excluding the operations attribute.

The **other** section consists of ephemeral attributes added
dynamically by the server. These are not subject to access
control. Currently, the operations attribute is the only ephemeral
attribute.

### Rights Hierarchy

As mentioned earlier, some rights imply other rights. The following
diagram shows the full hierarchy of rights.

![Rights Hierarchy]({{ site.url }}{{ site.baseurl }}/docs/reference/assets/rights-hierarchy.png)

The **edit-acl** right implies all others and acts as an **all**
rights identifer. This hierarchy is used when normalizing an ACL to
make all the rights explicit.

## Collection ACLs

Access to resource collections are also goverened by ACLs. However,
these are set by the developer and cannot be modified by users of a
Nuvla server.

The following shows an example of the ACL for the session resource
collection: 

```json
{
  "query": ["group/nuvla-anon"],
  "add":   ["group/nuvla-anon"]
}
```

There are only two rights: query and add.  The add right governs who
can add new resources to the collection. The query right governs who
can search the collection. **Note that the content of any search
respects the ACLs of the individual resources.**

As these ACLs are specified by the developer, it only makes sense to
include the special groups in these ACLs. 

## Special Groups

There are three special groups that can appear in ACLs:

 - **group/nuvla-admin**: consists of all users who have administrator
   rights to the service.  Administrators have all rights to all
   resources.
 - **group/nuvla-user**: consists of all authenticated users on the
   platform. That is, any user who is logged in will have this group
   in their session claims.
 - **group/nuvla-anon**: consists of all users of the platform,
   whether authenticated or not. All sessions will have this group in
   their claims.

The membership of the group/nuvla-admin can be managed by the
administrators of the platform.  Adding people to that group makes
them administrators.

The other two groups are treated specially by the Nuvla server and do
not have a list of users that can be maintained by the group resource.
