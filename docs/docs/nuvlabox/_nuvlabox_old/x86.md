NuvlaBox Ubuntu OS
========

For x86 platform, we recommend using the Ubuntu operating system.

The following dependencies are required on your Ubuntu installation:

 * *Docker (version 18 or higher)*
 * *Docker Compose (version 1.21 or higher)*
 
If you intend to communicate with your NuvlaBox via VPN (for example to avoid using public IP addresses), you will need an OpenVPN client.
