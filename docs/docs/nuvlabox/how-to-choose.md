# You should choose:

#### NuvlaBox Engine...

> if all you want is to take an existing functional device (with an OS and Docker Engine already installed), and turn it into an Edge device, so that you can share its computing power for all sorts of edge processing.


---

#### NuvlaBox OS...

> if you have an hardware platform but no Operating System installed, and you'd like to dedicate and optimize it for the Edge by flashing a new customized and edge-specific OS into it.
