# Inviting Users

Bob can invite users to Nuvla. The process is simple. Once logged-in, click on the *Invite User* from the top right dropdown menu.

Write the email address of the user to invite and click *invite a user*.

The user will receive an invitation email with instructions.

From the moment the invitation is sent, you can then start sharing resources with the future user - e.g. credentials, modules, service infrastructures.
