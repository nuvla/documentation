# Inviting Users

TODO: do we still allow that?  Or only via groups?

To invite users, the process is simple. Once logged-in, click on the *Invite User* from the top right dropdown menu.

Write the email address of the user to invite and click *invite a user*.

The user will receive an invitation email with instructions.

From the moment the invitation is sent, you can then start sharing resources with the future user - e.g. credentials, modules, service infrastructures.
