# REST API

Nuvla provides a uniform and extensible HTTP-based RESTful API, for the management of Nuvla resources. A Nuvla resource can be anything you can perform an action on, through Nuvla, like your own user profile, a Nuvla application, credentials, etc.

Users have at their disposal all the usual CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, plus Searching, Querying, Bulk delete and Bulk actions.
