# CaaS Infrastructures

Container as a Service (CaaS) running in the cloud can be used by Nuvla to deploy applications.

If you already have a Kubernetes or Docker Swarm cluster, you can simply [register it to host user container applications](#add-caas-or-other-infrastructure-services).

If you do not have a CaaS yet, simply follow [these instructions](#container-as-a-service-infrastructures).
