# Nuvla - Main Workflows

Understanding the main Nuvla workflows is important to better apprehend security settings and how data and control flows work across the platform.


<!--
## Quarantine Workflow

This section describes the [NuvlaBox](/nuvlabox/nuvlabox.html) quarantine workflow following the detection of a suspected or effective cyber or physical attack on the device, its software and/or its network environment.

**1. A NuvlaBox has been compromised**

**1a. A security breach has been detected by the customer**

Either based os suspicious activity or malfunctioning of the NuvlaBox, the customer might detect a security vulnerability and decide to act on it.

**1b. A security breach has been detected by the NuvlaBox itself**

Using internal services and integrity checks, or a third party cyber-intrusion detection app, a security vulnerability is detected

--- 

**2. Reporting the security issue**

A compromised NuvlaBox is reported in Nuvla, which changes its state to “quarantined”. Compromised devices become non-operational, and only a manual intervention (both on-site and remotely from Nuvla) can re-activate the NuvlaBox.

**2a. The customer takes action**

The owner of the NuvlaBox, with his/her Nuvla credentials, can mark the NuvlaBox as compromised.

**2b. SixSq/NuvlaBox takes action**

An action can be taken automatically, as soon as the security vulnerability has been detected, to mark the NuvlaBox record as compromised.
