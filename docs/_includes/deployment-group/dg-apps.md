> **NOTE:** Once the deployment group is saved, before you can start it, you must ensure all mandatory app input parameters are provided. A validation error message will show and the relevant tabs will be highlighted in red. 

Now it's a good idea to review the input parameters for the apps.  You can access them by clicking on the *Apps* tab.
