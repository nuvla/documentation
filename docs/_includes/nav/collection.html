  outputs the main navigation links for `pages`. It also assigns arrays of pages
  to variables inspected by `nav/crumbs` and `nav/toc`.
  
  When `key` is `nil`, `pages` is `site.html_pages`; otherwise `key` is the name
  of a collection, and `pages` are the pages of that collection. (Pages without
  a `title` are automatically excluded in the former case, but Jekyll provides
  default titles for pages in collections, so their untitled pages are not
  automatically excluded.)
  
  `collection` first groups `pages` by their `parent` fields, creating an
  unsorted array of hashes, assigned to `nav_parenthood`.
  
  When `pages` contains the current `page`, `collection` calls `nav/page` to 
  search for the navigation path to `page`, then:
  - assigns to `nav_page_path` the string of page titles leading to `page`,
  - assigns to `nav_page_ancestors` the array of ancestors of `page`, and
  - assigns  to `nav_page_children` the array of children of `page`.

  When pages are stored in folders whose nesting corresponds to the parent
  relation, only nodes whose folder path is a prefix of `page.path` need to be
  searched. For larger sites, using folder paths to direct searching for `page`
  can exponentially reduce the build time. To avoid dependence on assumptions
  about the folders used to store pages, however, exhaustive search is needed
  as a fall-back when directed search fails.
  
  Finally, `collection` outputs the main navigation links for `pages`. 
  
  The presence of navigation expanders requires the navigation links for the
  entire site to be output on every page. To reduce build time, the navigation
  links for inactive top-level nodes are cached. (It would be possible to cache
  also the navigation links for inactive lower-level nodes, but that does not
  reduce the build time signficantly.)
