# Add CaaS or Other Infrastructure Services

Adding a new infrastructure service or registering an existing infrastructure service to Nuvla is simple. First, on the *Cloud* page, click the *+Add* button.

Then, select the type of service you want to add. Currently, we support (Docker) Swarm and Kubernetes CaaS.

From there, fill the form, including the endpoint to the service reachable from Nuvla.

You can also share this service with users, using the *share button* (highlighted in red in the above screenshot).

The same procedure can be used to add other infrastructure services, such as an S3 (Simple Storage Service) compatible service (e.g. MinIO).
