NuvlaBox Engine
========

The NuvlaBox Engine (**NBE**) is the heart of the NuvlaBox (**NB**). It provides the foundation services of the NB, which in turn ensure a robust, feature-rich and secure remote management from Nuvla.

The NBE is implemented as a set of loosely coupled, open-source and containerised micro-services. You can find NBE's source code in [NuvlaBox's GitHub organisation](https://github.com/nuvlabox).

You can find all releases of the NBE at [https://github.com/nuvlabox/deployment](https://github.com/nuvlabox/deployment).
