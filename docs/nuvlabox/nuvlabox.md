With NuvlaBox, you can transform most ARM and x86 hardware platforms into a smart edge device, to be managed by a Nuvla service.

To ensure a smooth edge deployment and operation, SixSq has certified a number of [hardware platforms](https://sixsq.com/products-and-services/nuvlabox/tech-spec), including x86 and ARM based systems, from HPE, Dell, Logic Supply, Raspberry Pi and Nvidia.  

But if you prefer to run on a different platform, SixSq offers a certification service, which will ensure you are able to deploy to this platform, at scale, without issues. Further, SixSq can also certify base operating systems (OS).  Therefore, if you have your own operating system, as long as it supports Docker, SixSq also offers a certification process, ensuring that your operating system can run as a NuvlaBox OS.
