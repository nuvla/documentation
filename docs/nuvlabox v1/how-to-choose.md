# NuvlaBox Engine or OS?

NuvlaBox allows you to create a smart edge device, such that you can share its computing power for all sorts of edge processing tasks. You have two ways of achieving this goal.

#### NuvlaBox Engine

> you can take an existing functional device (with an OS and Docker Engine already installed), and turn it into an Edge device. [Follow these instructions](/nuvlabox/nuvlabox-engine).


#### NuvlaBox OS

> if you have a hardware platform without an Operating System (OS) installed, you can install the NuvlaBox OS, a dedicated and optimised OS for the edge. [Follow these instructions](/nuvlabox/nuvlabox-os).

Both options will result in a functional NuvlaBox, connected to a Nuvla service, able to deliver an edge computing solution, at scale.
