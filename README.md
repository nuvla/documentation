# Nuvla Documentation

The Nuvla platform allows you to manage your container-based
applications on multiple infrastructures, including those on the edge.

This repository contains the core documentation for the software.
The resulting [Nuvla Software Documentation Website](https://docs.nuvla.io) is deployed as GitHub pages website.

The code for the platform can be found in the other repositories within the [Nuvla](https://github.com/nuvla)
and [NuvlaEdge](https://github.com/nuvlaedge) organisations on GitHub.

The documentation is written in Markdown using Jekyll.


## Local setup

To run the documentation locally, do the following (assuming you are on a Mac):

1. Install Jekyll: [https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#install-ruby](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/installation/macos/#install-ruby)
2. Run this command in this directory: `bundle exec jekyll serve -wl`
3. Point your browser to: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)

The local website should be automagically reloading when you save files.  Happy documenting!
